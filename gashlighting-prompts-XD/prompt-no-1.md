# Python Journey Prompt (GitHub + LinkedIn)

I am a 6th-semester student building a practical, industry-focused Python foundation to prepare for solving LeetCode 150 problems efficiently.

## My Objective

Build strong problem-solving skills in Python first, then transition to DSA and LeetCode with speed, accuracy, and consistency.

## What I Need

I want a practical learning path (simple to advanced) focused on real coding ability, not textbook theory.

Topics to master deeply:

- Variables and data types
- If/else and decision making
- Loops and loop patterns
- Math and number logic
- Arrays/Lists
- Strings
- Queues
- HashSets
- HashMaps (Dictionaries)
- Tuples
- Heaps
- Functions
- Classes (problem-solving level)

## Learning Constraints

- Time-efficient: no unnecessary content
- Practice-heavy: coding first, theory minimal
- Shortcut-aware: Pythonic and efficient approaches
- Industry-oriented: useful for interviews and real development

## Final Goal

Complete Python preparation, then solve LeetCode 150 with confidence.

This repository documents that journey step by step.
